# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview

This project serves as a movie website where the user can search any movie and add the selected movie to their watch list and give the movie a rating of their own choice out 10.

This project uses all of the famous React Hooks knows as " useState, useEffect and useRef" to perform the add and delete functionalities. 

Another functionality that is present in this React project is that once you add a movie in your watched list, it will store that movie in the local storage using the "Local Storage" browser API.

Moreover, to search for the movies,this project uses an APi called "www.omdbapi.com". To use this api, follow the given steps:

=>Visit [OMDB API]([www.omdbapi.com](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)).

=>Register yourself and get your own API key.

=>Replace your newly generated API key in "useMovie.js" in the "KEY' variable.

## How to run the project?

To run the project, follow the given steps:

1) Download the project either using git commands or "Download ZIP" option from the main page of repository.

2) Generate your API Key and replace it in "useMovie.js" file. (Steps to generate API key are given above.)

3) If you do not have "node modules" folder install, simply write "npm install" command on the terminal in the project directory to install the necessary dependencies.

4) After doing all the steps correctly, simple write "npm start" command on the terminal.

### Note: To make sure all these steps work perfectly, you have to navigate in the project folder. If you enter the above mentioned commands in any other folder, it might not work correctly!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
